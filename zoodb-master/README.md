ZooDB is an object oriented database based on the JDO 3.0 standard.
It is written by Tilmann Zäschke since 2008, since 2011 with friendly support by the GlobIS Group at ETH Zurich.
ZooDB is currently licensed under GPLv3 (GNU Public License), see file COPYING.

ZooDB is also available via maven:

Bug Bounty #2
=============
Starting March 3rd 2017, until May 31st 2017, there is a bug bounty for severe bugs concerning indexing and database consistency.

Bounty:
- The bounty is 100CHF per qualifying bug report. 
- The total maximum number of rewarded bugs is 10.
- At my discretion I can choose to accept bugs as valid/applicable even if they do not strictly adhere to all rules.


Requirements:
- The bug must be reproducible with a small program which needs to be submitted to me (per email or as GitHub issue on the ZooDB project) as part of the bug report.
- The bug must be reproducible by me (I will try hard and contact you if I can't reproduce it) with the latest version of the master branch (at time of submission).
- There is no open bug description that documents the same problem (i.e. you should only submit your bug if there is no open bug report for the same/similar problem)
- JVM crashes do not count (they are JVM bugs).
- Problems caused by the schema evolution API will not be accepted.
- Bugs must fall into at least one of following categories: 
  - Category 1 bugs: The bugs must reproduce a serious problem with indexing (index corruption or unreasonable behaviour) during index creation, usage or deletion.
  - Category 2 bugs: The bugs must cause database corruption to a point where ZooDB cannot recover by simply restarting ZooDB. Corruption of the user-domain model due to incorrect domain code (or code that relies on unsupported functionality in ZooDB) does _not_ count.
  - Category 3 bugs: Violation of transaction consistency in single user mode. Examples include missing or incorrect updates to the database (not everything is written correctly), being able to access data that should have been overwritten with the last commit, or rollback not working properly (not all persistent instances are rolled back properly).  
  - Category 4 bugs: Queries returning incorrect results.



Bug Bounty
==========
The last bug hunt started June 11 2016 and ended June 30 2016. The hunt was for severe bugs concerning indexing and database consistency. No bugs were reported.


Current Status
==============
Under development, but already in use by some university projects.


Current Features
================
- Works as normal database or as in-memory database.
- Fast (4x faster than db4o using db4o's PolePosition benchmark suite).
- Reasonably scalable, has been used successfully with 60,000,000+ objects in a 30+ GB database.
- Maximum object count: 2^63.
- Maximum database size depends on (configurable) cluster size: 2^31 * CLUSTER_SIZE. With default cluster size: 2^31 * 4KB = 8TB.
- Crash-recovery/immunity (dual flush, no log-file required).
- Standard stuff: commit/rollback, query, indexing, lazy-loading, transitive persistence & updates (persistence by reachability), automatic schema definition, embedded object support (second class objects).
- Queries support standard operators, indexing, path queries, parameters, aggregation (avg, max, min), projection, uniqueness, ORDER BY, setting result classes (partial), methods (partial).
- Multi-user/-session capability (optimistic TX), but currently not terribly efficient.
- Thread-safe.
- XML export/import (currently only binary attributes).
- Some examples are available in the 'examples' folder.
- Open source (GPLv3).

Note that some features may be available in the latest snapshot only.

Current Limitations
===================
- Schema evolution is ~90% complete (updating OIDs is not properly supported, no low level queries).
  --> Queries don't work with lazy evolution.
- No backup (except copying the DB file).
- Single process usage only (No stand-alone server).
- JDO only partially supported:
  - Some query features not supported: group by, range, variables, imports, setting result classes (partial).
  - No XML config or Annotations; configuration only via Java API.
  - Manual enhancement of classes required (insert activateRead()/activateWrite() & extend provided super-class).
- Little documentation (some example code), but follows JDO 3.0 spec.
